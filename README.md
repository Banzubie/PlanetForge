# PlanetForge

### Overview

PlanetForge is a create your own planet aplication. This was made when I was challenged to create a fully functioning app in a 24 hour period. I wanted to create something that was visually striking so I used some new technologies for myself with 3d model rendering using Three.js and React Three Fiber. I had fun creating this application and it was a great exercise to see what I could accomplish in a short period of time with an entirely new technology. I plan to expand upon this project in the future when time permits.
